# LPA
[Label propagation algorithm (LPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label_propagation_algorithm) is a semi-supercised machine learning alogorthm that assigns labels to previously unlabeled data points. At the start of the algorithm, a (generally small) subset of the data points have labels (or classifications). These labels are propagated to the unlabeled points throughout the course of the algorithm.

# Instruction
Install python3.

Install networkx.

Run nwxlpa.py.

# Result
The image of every label with random color.
